## 🔧 Backend Setup

The backend server (`server.js`) provides:

### Endpoints:

1. **`GET /api/neighborhoods`**
   - Returns all neighborhoods with weekly consumption data
   - Data structure:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "name": "Mahalle Adı",
         "electricity": [1000, 1200, ...],
         "water": [50, 60, ...],
         "gas": [200, 250, ...]
       }
     ]
     ```

2. **`GET /api/neighborhoods/search?q=query`**
   - Returns filtered neighborhoods based on search query
   - Same data structure as above

3. **`GET /api/import-csv`**
   - Imports data from CSV file to MongoDB
   - Run this first to populate the database

---

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Development Mode:

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Kaynak_Tuketimi_Analiz_Sistemi
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the React client (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

3. **Import CSV data (first time only):**
   Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/import-csv`

4. **Access the dashboard:**
   Open: `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Mode:

1. **Build the React app:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   Open: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No neighborhoods loaded
**Solution:** Ensure MongoDB is connected and run `/api/import-csv` first

### Issue: Dropdown not appearing
**Solution:** Check browser console for React errors

### Issue: API calls failing
**Solution:** Verify backend server is running on port 5000

### Issue: Chart not rendering
**Solution:** Check that Recharts is installed: `npm install recharts`
